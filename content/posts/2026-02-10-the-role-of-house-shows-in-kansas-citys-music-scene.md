### What are House Shows?

House shows are informal concerts held in private residences rather than traditional venues. They can range from small gatherings with a handful of attendees to larger events with dozens of fans. The charm of house shows lies in their accessibility and intimacy, enabling artists to perform in front of engaged audiences in a relaxed environment. For many emerging musicians, house shows serve as a crucial stepping stone, providing them with opportunities to build a following and gain performance experience without the logistical challenges of larger venues.

In Kansas City, house shows have become a staple of the local music scene, creating a platform for diverse genres and styles. From indie rock to folk and hip-hop, these gatherings showcase the rich variety of musical talent that the city has to offer.
